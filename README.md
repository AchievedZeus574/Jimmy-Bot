# CotD or Cat of the Day

A simple discord bot designed to access reddit and grab an image, originally designed to look through some cat related subreddits. Can very easily be made to crawl any subreddit by modifying the list in `config.ini`
Also has some old functions before it was dedicated to CotD, 1liner which grabs a random string from `1lines.csv` and 4liases that does the same, but with `4liases.csv`
